# AI_Learning
A collection of code produced as a result of my process of learning ML

## Basics
Code I wrote based on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_ikDlimN6A, by Daniel Bourke, containing basics of PyTorch.

## Classification networks
Code I wrote based on the same video tutorial as above, contains the basics of Classification Neural Networks

## Neural_Network_From_Scratch
Code I wrote based on knowledge from the book "Neural Networks from Scratch" - (https://nnfs.io). Mostly consists of NN written from pure Python with a mix of Numpy. 

## Whisper_implementation
Implementation of OpenAI Whisper, for Pseudo-live transcription.

## NLP
The subject that I am currently learning (very WIP)
